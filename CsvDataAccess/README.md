# CSV Data Access Performance Comparison

A C# .NET 8 application that demonstrates performance optimization techniques for CSV data processing by comparing two different data storage approaches.

## Project Overview

This application benchmarks and compares two implementations for parsing and storing CSV data in memory:

- **Old Solution**: Generic approach using `Dictionary<string, object>`
- **New Solution**: Optimized approach using type-specific dictionaries

The project measures memory usage, execution time, and validates that both implementations produce identical results.

## Architecture

### Old Solution (`OldSolution` namespace)
- **`Row`**: Generic row class storing all values in a `Dictionary<string, object>`
- **`TableData`**: Container for rows and column metadata
- **`TableDataBuilder`**: Converts CSV data to the old format

**Characteristics:**
- Stores every column value (including nulls/empties)
- Uses boxing for value types (performance overhead)
- Simple but memory-intensive approach

### New Solution (`NewSolution` namespace)
- **`FastRow`**: Optimized row class with separate type-specific dictionaries:
  - `Dictionary<string, int>` for integers
  - `Dictionary<string, bool>` for booleans
  - `Dictionary<string, decimal>` for decimals
  - `Dictionary<string, string>` for strings
- **`FastTableData`**: Optimized container
- **`FastTableDataBuilder`**: Converts CSV data to the optimized format

**Optimizations:**
- [x] Skips null/empty values (memory savings)
- [x] Avoids boxing with type-specific storage
- [x] Faster data access through targeted lookups

## Data Type Detection

The application automatically detects and converts CSV values:

| Input | Detected Type | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `"TRUE"` | `bool` | `true` |
| `"FALSE"` | `bool` | `false` |
| `"123.45"` | `decimal` | `123.45m` |
| `"42"` | `int` | `42` |
| `"Hello"` | `string` | `"Hello"` |
| Empty/null | Skipped | - |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 (recommended)

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Place your CSV file as `sampleData.csv` in the output directory
3. Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Sample Output

```
Test results for old code:
Memory increase in bytes: 1,234,567
Time of loading the CSV was 00:00:00.1234567.
Time of reading the CSV was 00:00:00.0987654.

Test results for new code:
Memory increase in bytes: 987,654
Time of loading the CSV was 00:00:00.0876543.
Time of reading the CSV was 00:00:00.0654321.

## Performance Benefits

The `FastRow` implementation typically provides:

- **Reduced Memory Usage**: No boxing overhead + skipped empty values
- **Faster Data Access**: Type-specific dictionaries eliminate casting
- **Better Performance**: Optimized for large CSV files

## Testing Components

- **`TableDataPerformanceMeasurer`**: Measures memory allocation and execution time
- **`ContentEqualityChecker`**: Validates that both implementations produce identical results
- **JIT Warm-up**: Initial test run to ensure fair performance comparison

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- **Performance Optimization**: How data structure choices impact performance
- **Memory Management**: Techniques to reduce memory allocation and boxing overhead
- **Type Safety**: Benefits of avoiding boxing/unboxing operations
- **Benchmarking**: Proper performance measurement techniques using `Stopwatch` and `GC.GetTotalMemory`
- **Design Patterns**: Builder pattern and interface segregation principle
- **CSV Processing**: Efficient parsing and type conversion strategies

## Customization

To test with your own CSV files:
1. Replace `sampleData.csv` with your file in the output directory
2. Ensure your CSV follows standard format (comma-separated, header row)
3. The application will automatically detect and convert data types based on content

## Key Performance Insights

### Memory Optimization Techniques
- **Skip Empty Values**: `FastRow` only stores non-null, non-empty values
- **Avoid Boxing**: Type-specific dictionaries prevent value type boxing
- **Efficient Storage**: Separate collections reduce memory fragmentation

### Benchmarking Best Practices
- **JIT Warm-up**: First test run excluded from measurements
- **Garbage Collection**: Force GC before memory measurements
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Measures both build time and data access time

## How It Works

1. **CSV Reading**: `CsvReader` parses CSV files into `CsvData` objects
2. **Type Detection**: Both builders automatically detect data types from string values
3. **Data Storage**: 
   - Old solution stores everything in `Dictionary<string, object>`
   - New solution uses type-specific dictionaries in `FastRow`
4. **Performance Measurement**: Tracks memory allocation and execution time
5. **Validation**: Ensures both approaches produce identical results

## Expected Results

Typical performance improvements with `FastRow`:
- **20-40% memory reduction** (varies by data sparsity)
- **15-30% faster data access** (eliminates boxing/unboxing)
- **Improved scalability** for large datasets
